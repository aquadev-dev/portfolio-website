<h2>About</h2>
<p align="left">
  After purchasing the website hosting and domain name in January 2024, I decided to create a website for my portfolio to help me get a placement. During July 2024, I engaged in my three-stage plan to develop this website. I wanted to finish three projects before I started writing the text, eventually leading me to create the first version of the website using HTML, and CSS.
