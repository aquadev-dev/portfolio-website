            <h4 class="section-subtitle">General</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                From a very young age, I've had a passion for programming and knowing how things such as video games and software work. I mainly have an interest in developing multiplayer games and writing efficient code to develop games.
            </div>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">Education</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
               <p>I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Games Programming at the University of Huddersfield, and I am currently in my second year out of a 4-year course, where I'm starting to specialize in more games-related modules and subjects. This year has been brilliant so far as I've learned so much more being able to expand my knowledge about the games side of computer science.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I've previously completed a Level 3 BTEC in Digital Games Production and A-Levels in Media Studies and Sociology, with grades D*, B, and C, respectively.</p>

            <h4 class="section-subtitle">Spare Time</h4>
            <div class="section-content last-p"
>
                <p>In my spare time, I am a Student Ambassador for the University, which involves me helping out at various open days and taster days by taking people between buildings and giving tours. I also play rugby union for the men's rugby union team, the Huddersfield Sharks, which I really enjoy. You can also catch me playing racing games like Trackmania and the F1 games and even watching real-life Formula 1 on the weekends when they do race.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also dedicate some of my free time to working on projects to display for this website, including my full-feature discord bot for the official Computer Science server for the Uni, My Poll & Suggestion Discord Bots and Game Jams such as the ones on my GitHub.</p>
