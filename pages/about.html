            <h4 class="section-subtitle">General</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                From a very young age, I've had a passion for programming and knowing how things such as video games and software work. I mainly have an interest in developing multiplayer games and writing efficient code to develop games.
            </div>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">Education</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
               <p>I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Games Programming at the University of Huddersfield, and I am currently in my final year, where I'm starting to write my dissertation and focus on more advanced game development techniques. This year has been brilliant so far as I've learned so much more being able to expand and apply my knowledge about the games side of computer science.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I've previously completed a Level 3 BTEC in Digital Games Production and A-Levels in Media Studies and Sociology, with grades D*, B, and C, respectively.</p>

            <h4 class="section-subtitle">Spare Time</h4>
            <div class="section-content last-p"
>
                <p>In my spare time, I am a Student Ambassador for the University, which involves me helping out at various open days and taster days by taking people between buildings and giving tours. I also play rugby union for the men's rugby union team, the Huddersfield Sharks, which I really enjoy. You can also catch me playing racing games like Trackmania and the F1 games and even watching real-life Formula 1 on the weekends when they do race.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Furthermore, I play bass guitar playing various rock/metal tunes from bands such as AC/DC, Metallica and Green Day. I also listen to a variety of music genres, including rock, metal, rap, and alternative.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, I do dedicate some of my free time to working on projects to display for this website, including my Random Dungeon Game in C++, My Racing Checkpoint System and Game Jams such as the ones on my GitHub.</p>
